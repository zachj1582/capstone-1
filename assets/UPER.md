<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* build a e-commerce site that handles the inventory management process as well.
* need a customer view and a admin view
* customer view needs to handle showing products, shopping cart and payment, search functionality with error handling when the item does not exist, pics of inventory, error handling for out of stock items
* admin view needs to handle adding inventory, set prices, produce sales and business reports
*
*
*
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* wireframe.
* build out each component and method completely before moving on
* MVP:
* cust view components- search, product view->product display, cart view->product display
*admin view components- cost of sales reports, sales report, inventory ordering report


* Story Board:
* cust view: main product view => 
* Header- static; title, cart link, <= MVP, additional features => About page link
*
*
*
*
*
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* set coding times with breaks
* work through each piece and method before moving on to the next item
* break down each component into seperate blocks to get done, continue updating step 2 with each block to add to the story board
* MVP first and then added functions if time affords
*
